            %   The first six possible inputs consist of the three
            %   Name-Value pairs specified in the documentation and help
            %   text above (RigidBodyTree, SolverAlgorithm, and
            %   SolverParameters, and their associated values).

            %   The following input is for internal use only, and may not
            %   be supported in a future release:
            %      The constructor can also accept 8 inputs. These include
            %      the six inputs above, as well as an additional

            %                      that does not call platform-specific
            %                      time functions.
